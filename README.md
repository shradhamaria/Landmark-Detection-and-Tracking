# Landmark Detection and Tracking

This repository, part of the Udacity Nanodegree program, focuses on landmark detection and tracking. It includes Jupyter Notebooks that provide an overview of the concepts and implementation details of the landmark detection and tracking process.

## Overview
- **1. Robot Moving and Sensing.html/1. Robot Moving and Sensing.ipynb**: Introduction to robot movement and sensing in the context of landmark detection.
- **2. Omega and Xi, Constraints.html/2. Omega and Xi, Constraints.ipynb**: Understanding constraints using Omega and Xi matrices in landmark detection.
- **3. Landmark Detection and Tracking.html/3. Landmark Detection and Tracking.ipynb**: Implementation and tracking of landmarks using sensor measurements.
- **helpers.py**: Python script containing helper functions for the landmark detection and tracking process.
- **robot_class.py**: Implementation of the robot class used in the Jupyter Notebooks.
  
## How to Use
This project, initiated three years ago as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program, provides an educational exploration of landmark detection and tracking. To explore the code and run the experiments, open the respective Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., 1. Robot Moving and Sensing.ipynb, 2. Omega and Xi, Constraints.ipynb, etc.) and execute the cells sequentially.

Please note that this repository was last updated three years ago as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. The provided materials offer insights into landmark detection and tracking, serving as a learning resource for those interested in the field.
